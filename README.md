## Node View





This mod lets you see information about the node/entity you are looking at.



Features:



* let's you see:
  * the name of the node/Entity you are looking at
  * the tool, that's needed to break the node
  * the health of an entity
  * the mod, that the node/entity belongs to
* open the editor with /nv:
  * edit the color of the background
  * edit the hud position
  * change the health to hearts/points



Advanced Features:

* entities and liquids can be enabled/disabled in the settings
* you can force the texture size, that is displayed, in the settings (when you use a texture pack, that is > or < than 16px, the shown texture will be displayed too big or too small: use this setting to force it to a fixed size (texturesthat are bigger or smaller than your selected size, will be displayed too big or too small))
* when you turn the secure.enable\_security setting in the mintest.conf off, every texture will be shown Right and you don't have to set a fixed size (!only use this with safe mods)
